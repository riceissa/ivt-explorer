    We stipulate that a is less than b, because the cases a=b and a &gt; b are less interesting.
    If a=b, then the interval [a,b] is just the singleton set {a}, so the function consists of a single point (a, f(a)), which is not interesting.
    If a &gt; b, then the interval [a,b] is empty, so the function is the empty function, so the theorem is vacuously true.

    A root of a function f is a number x such that f(x) = 0.

    <p>The least upper bound property for the real numbers only works when the set S in question is nonempty and bounded above.</p>
    <p>If the set is empty, i.e. S = Ø, then <i>any</i> number is an upper bound. For example, vacuously for any x ∈ S, we have x ≤ 1 so the number 1 is an upper bound—this works because there isn't a number in S, so anything we say about such a number is true. This works for any number, not just 1. This means that while there are upper bounds, there is no <i>least</i> upper bound, because for any upper  bound, we can just subtract 1 to get an even smaller one.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if S is not bounded above, then there is no upper bound at all, so there can't be a least upper bound either.</p>
