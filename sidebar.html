    We stipulate that \(a\) is less than \(b\), because the cases \(a=b\) and \(a &gt; b\) are less interesting.
    If \(a=b\), then the interval \([a,b]\) is just the singleton set \(\{a\}\), so the function consists of a single point \((a, f(a))\), which is not interesting.
    If \(a &gt; b\), then the interval \([a,b]\) is empty, so the function is the empty function, so the theorem is vacuously true.

  <div id="what_is_root" style="display: none;">
    A root of a function \(f\) is a number \(x\) such that \(f(x) = 0\).

  <div id="why_nonempty_and_bounded_set" style="display: none;">
    <p>The least upper bound property for the real numbers only works when the set \(S\) in question is nonempty and bounded above.</p>
    <p>If the set is empty, i.e. \(S = \emptyset\), then <i>any</i> number is an upper bound. For example, vacuously for any \(x \in S\), we have \(x \leq 1\) so the number \(1\) is an upper boundâ€”this works because there isn't a number in \(S\), so anything we say about such a number is true. This works for any number, not just \(1\). This means that while there are upper bounds, there is no <i>least</i> upper bound, because for any upper  bound, we can just subtract \(1\) to get an even smaller one.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if \(S\) is not bounded above, then there is no upper bound at all, so there can't be a least upper bound either.</p>
